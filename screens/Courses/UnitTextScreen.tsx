            dealing with psychological disorders or is going through physical,

            Now, this is a highly simplified definition and doesn’t represent
            the concept of health entirely. Health can be considered as the
            ability to adapt to physical, environmental, and social challenges.
            After all, isn’t it the adaptations that have helped humans evolve?
            Even though we have progressed technologically to a great extent but
            ‘health’ has been compromised in the process. While our ancestors
            may not have had the sharpest brain, they did have a much more
            active lifestyle, they used to move hundreds of kilometers to find
            food, water, and shelter. Evolution changed everything,
            technological advances have put us in a state of no to very few
            activities to perform the same task. The modern man is smart,
            technologically adept, and knows much more than his forefathers, but
            is sadly confined to a screen. Health is compromised as a result of
            leading a stagnant lifestyle where one eats a lot and sits a lot
            more. All these changes have happened in a short period (i.e.
            decades, rather than centuries) and the human bodies have not had
            the time to adapt yet. Evolutionary adaptations happen after
            thousands of years, but these technological advances came after the
            mid-1900s, so we didn’t get too much time to adapt, thus our body’s
            functions are still the same as our ancestors, but we have less
            physical work now. Generally speaking, a healthy person has
            well-functioning internal systems. The indications of the same are
            shared in figure 2. Review the list and identify if one can be
            called ‘healthy’.

            It is important to note that just ‘looking’ healthy need not make a
            person healthy. Health must always be looked at holistically. Now,
            an important question arises - Are health and fitness the same
            thing? The answer is NO.
